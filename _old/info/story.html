    <p>"Stephen, how much do we still have to load?" Called out Nikola from the cargo hold.</p>

    <p>"Plus or minus seventy eight tons. Margin of error equals sixty tons"</p>

    <p>"No way, we can’t fit that much weight on the ship!"</p>

    <p>"Ouch, that hurts! I meant to say exactly five, no, five hundred tons. Errrr..."</p>

    <p>Sofia stopped tinkering with the dashboard and looked at Stephen, who also seemed to be surprised at his own
        words.</p>

    <p>Nikola interrupts Stephens confusion, "Stephen, how many Sofias do you see now?"</p>

    <p>"Three... six... four hundred and twenty eight... mama miaaaa..." he shakes his head and shuts his eyes
        tight.</p>

    <p>"Nikola, where is your demonic exorcism device thingamabob?" Sofia asks.</p>

    <p>"Huh, you’ve never referred to my language programmator like that before," said Nikola poking his head around the
        corner. "Why do you need it?"<a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

        <p>"It looks like our big friend has got a big problem with another module. This time it looks like his speech

        <p>"Stephen!" Nikola shouted as he walked back down the hall. "Can you tell me how many stars there are in our
            galaxy?"</p>

        <p>"About seven, or maybe eighteen."</p>

        <p>"Calm down Sofia, he’s always fuzzy about numbers. He'll be fine!"</p>

        <p>"Har, Har - very funny. Go get that thingamajig. We need to fix this guy."</p>
