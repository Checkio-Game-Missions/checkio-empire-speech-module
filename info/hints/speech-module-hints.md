## I have no idea how to start solving this mission

Try to "break" a number of digits with various positions.
It can be easily done with integer division `n//10`.

## I need some help to proceed with the mission

You can gather a list of fragments and then put them in the string.

```python
str_number = " ".join(words)
```

## I am gone half way through. Need help!

Be careful with redundant white-spaces.

## I am stuck. I need a small hint.

For tens and hundreds (40, 100, ...) you should "lose" the last word.
